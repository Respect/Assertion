The power of [Validation][] into an assertion library.

This library allows to use any rule from [Validation][] as an assertion. For a
complete list of rules, check the [list of rules][].

## Installation

Package is available on [Packagist][], it can be installed using [Composer][].

```shell
composer require respect/assertion
```

Works on PHP 7.3 or above.

## Another assertion library

There are two great PHP assertion libraries that are very much known in the PHP
community:

- [beberlei/assert][]
- [webmozart/assert][]

They are both extremely easy to use and have a lot of assertions. This library
has no intention to compete or do something better than them, the advantages and
the reason why this library was created is that [Validation][] has **a lot** of
rules and that this library also allows to use custom exceptions at runtime.

The idea of [Validation][] is to make easy to create chain of validations, it
has a very clean API. This library offers a more straightforward API for when
only a simple assertion is needed.

## Usage

The examples in the document will assume that this library is available in the
autoload and that the class `Respect\Assertion\Assert` is imported.

Any rule from [Validation][] can be used by the `Assert` class if the input is
passed as the first argument:

```php
// will throw an exception => 1 must be equals 5
Assert::equals(1, 5);

// will throw an exception => "string" must be of the type integer
Assert::intType('string');

// will not throw an exception
Assert::odd(5);
```

The exceptions that are throw are the same that [Validation][] throws, that also
allows message customization:

```php
// will throw an exception => 5 is the value that 1 should be
Assert::equals(1, 5, '{{compareTo}} is the value that {{input}} should be');
```

This library also allows the use of custom exceptions:

```php
// will throw the defined DomainException
Assert::between(42, 1, 10, true, new DomainException('Something is not right'));
```

That can be very useful if you want to throw custom exceptions. That was a great
idea from [Malukenho][]!

### That

You can chain assertions using `Assert::that($input)`, that allows you to perform
multiple assertions to the same input with less duplication.

```php
Assert::that($input)
    ->intVal('The number {{input}} must be an integer')
    ->positive('The number must be positive')
    ->lessThan(4)
    ->notEquals(2, new Exception('The number should never equals two'));
```

In the example above, as soon as any assertion fails, it will throw an exception.
You wish to chain validations and only check them all at the same time we suggest
you use the API from [Validation][].

### Not

Assertions can be executed with the `not` prefix which will assert the opposite
of the prefixed assertion:

```php
// will throw an exception => 2 must not be an even number
Assert::notEven(3);

// will throw an exception => 3 must not be in { 1, 2, 3, 4 }
Assert::notIn(3, [1, 2, 3, 4]);
```

If `not` is used without a suffix, this library will use [Equals][] to assert:

```php
// will throw an exception => 42 must not be equals 42
Assert::not(42, 42);
```

### All

Assertions can be executed with the `all` prefix which will assert all elements
in the input with the prefixed assertion:

```php
// will throw an exception => "3" in { 1, 2, "3" } must be of the type integer
Assert::allIntType([1, 2, '3']);
```

Differently from other assertion libraries the message shows not only the item
in the input that failed the assertion but also the input itself.

If `all` is used without a suffix, this library will use [Equals][] to assert:

```php
// will throw an exception => "A" in { "A", "B", "C" } must be equals "D"
Assert::all(['A', 'B', 'C'], 'D');
```

### Key

You can use `keyPresent` to check whether a key is present in an array.

```php
// will throw an exception => Key bar must be present
Assert::keyPresent(['foo' => true], 'bar');
```

You can use `keyNotPresent` to check whether a key is present in an array.

```php
// will throw an exception => Key bar must not be present
Assert::keyNotPresent(['bar' => 2], 'bar');
```

Also, with the `key` prefix it will assert the value of the array that contains
the specified key.

```php
// will throw an exception => foo must equal 3
Assert::key(['foo' => 2], 'foo', 3);
Assert::keyEquals(['foo' => 2], 'foo', 3);

// will throw an exception => bar must be negative
Assert::keyNegative(['bar' => 2], 'bar');

// will throw an exception => bar must not be of type integer
Assert::keyNotIntType(['bar' => 2], 'bar');

// will throw an exception => Key baz must be present
Assert::keyNegative(['foo' => 2], 'baz');

// will throw an exception => foo must exists
Assert::keyExists(['foo' => '/path/to/file.txt'], 'foo');
```

Not that `keyExists` assertion, will assert whether the value of key `foo` exists
in the Filesystem.

### Length

Assertions can be executed with the `length` prefix which will assert the length
of the input with the prefixed assertion:

```php
// will throw an exception => 6, the length of "string", must be between 10 and 15
Assert::lengthBetween('string', 10, 15);
```

As can be seen the message shows not only the length of the input that failed
the assertion but also the input itself.

The `length` prefix can also be used with arrays and instances of [Countable][]:

```php
// will throw an exception => 4, the length of { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, must be an odd number
Assert::lengthOdd([1, 2, 3, 4]);


// will throw an exception => 3, the length of `[traversable] (ArrayObject: { 1, 2, 3 })`, must be an even number
Assert::lengthEven(new ArrayObject([1, 2, 3]));
```

This library also allows you to use the `not` prefix after the `length` prefix:

```php
// will throw an exception => 2, the length of { 1, 2 }, must not be multiple of 2
Assert::lengthNotMultiple([1, 2], 2);
```

If `length` is used without a suffix, this library will use [Equals][] to assert:

```php
// will throw an exception => 9, the length of "something", must be equals 3
Assert::length('something', 3);
```

### Max

Assertions can be executed with the `max` prefix which will assert the maximum
value of the input with the prefixed assertion:

```php
// will throw an exception => 3, the maximum of { 1, 2, 3 }, must be between 5 and 10
Assert::maxBetween([1, 2, 3], 5, 10);
```

As it can already be seen, the message shows not only the maximum of the input
that failed the assertion but also the input itself.

The `max` prefix can be used with any [iterable][] value:

```php
// will throw an exception => 3, the maximum of { 1, 2, 3 }, must be an even number
Assert::maxEven([1, 2, 3]);


// will throw an exception => 60, the maximum of `[traversable] (ArrayObject: { 45, 60, 20 })`, must be a valid perfect square
Assert::maxPerfectSquare(new ArrayObject([45, 60, 20]));
```

This library also allows you to use the `not` prefix after the `max` prefix:

```php
// will throw an exception => 23, the maximum of { 23, 7, 20 }, must not be positive
Assert::maxNotPositive([23, 7, 20]);
```

If `max` is used without a suffix, this library will use [Equals][] to assert:

```php
// will throw an exception => "C", the maximum of { "A", "B", "C" }, must be equals "D"
Assert::max(['A', 'B', 'C'], 'D');
```

### Min

Assertions can be executed with the `min` prefix which will assert the minimum
value of the input with the prefixed assertion:

```php
// will throw an exception => 1, the minimum of { 1, 2, 3 }, must be between 5 and 10
Assert::minBetween([1, 2, 3], 5, 10);
```

As it can already be seen, the message shows not only the minimum of the input
that failed the assertion but also the input itself.

The `min` prefix can be used with any [iterable][] value:

```php
// will throw an exception => 1, the minimum of { 1, 2, 3 }, must be an even number
Assert::minEven([1, 2, 3]);


// will throw an exception => 20, the minimum of `[traversable] (ArrayObject: { 45, 60, 20 })`, must be a valid perfect square
Assert::minPerfectSquare(new ArrayObject([45, 60, 20]));
```

This library also allows you to use the `not` prefix after the `min` prefix:

```php
// will throw an exception => 7, the minimum of { 23, 7, 20 }, must not be positive
Assert::minNotPositive([23, 7, 20]);
```

If `min` is used without a suffix, this library will use [Equals][] to assert:

```php
// will throw an exception => "A", the minimum of { "A", "B", "C" }, must be equals "D"
Assert::min(['A', 'B', 'C'], 'D');
```
